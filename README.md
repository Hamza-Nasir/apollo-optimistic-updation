# Apollo Client Optimistic Updation guide

So recently, I worked on this large project where we were using Apollo Client with Hasura,
and our clients needed Optimistic Updation, which, as I came to know, was not an easy
thing to do.

Apollo's docs, while good, we're only helpful for looking at the API and what I could
and couldn't do. The examples weren't great for a beginner to find out HOW to do 
it.

So this guide serves as a dummy's guide to Apollo Optimistic Updation, so that you
don't have to suffer for 3 days straight (as I did :/)
